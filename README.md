# leveraging-llms-for-mcqa

## Setup
* Start by using your favorite package manager to install: `openai`
* Now register your API keys in `api_sectrets.py`. To do this, add a key and value for each API key you want to register to the dictionary in the `get_api_key_by_name` function. You'll need an OpenAI key for OpenAI API experiments, and a Jurassic key for Jurassic API experiments. You can use the existing keys or choose your own names for the keys.
